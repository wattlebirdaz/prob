    "This is a bad estimate because if we have seen an element with really high hash value early on, we will overestimate the number of distinct elements. For example if we somehow see an element with normalized hash value 0.99 early on, we will estimate the number of distinct elements to be 100. The hash function is uniform so it is equally likely to see an element with normalized hash value 0.99 as it is to see an element with normalized hash value 0.01. Therefore, it is hard to distinguish between a stream with 100 distinct elements and a stream with 1 distinct element.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Flajolet-Martin Algorithm uses the the position of the least significant 1 bit in the hash value to generate a skewed distribution from a uniform distribution. Intuitively, this skewness will make the estimate of the distinct element count by making high hash values less likely than low hash values. In the example above, we would be less likely to see an element with normalized hash value 0.99 than an element with normalized hash value 0.01.\n",
