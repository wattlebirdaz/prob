    "The fundamental distinction between operations that achieve $O(1)$ query time and those that operate in $O(logN)$ time primarily hinges on the nature of the query being performed. Specifically, $O(1)$ query time is typically associated with exact match queries, where the query is performed using a precise key to retrieve a corresponding value from a data structure, such as in the case of hash-based structures. On the other hand, $O(logN)$ query time is often linked to operations that involve a search or range query, where the goal is to locate an item or a set of items based on certain criteria within a sorted dataset, as seen in sort-based data structures like binary search trees. This distinction underscores the different capabilities and optimal use cases of these data structures, with hash-based structures excelling in scenarios requiring rapid access to individual items through specific keys, and sort-based structures being more suited to applications that benefit from ordered data and the ability to efficiently conduct searches or range queries."

    "1. Consider a scenario where you have a sorted list of numbers and need to determine the count of numbers within a specified range $[a, b]$. An offline data structure can be prepared using $O(N)$ time and space before executing any queries. For instance, with the list $[0.1, 0.4, 0.6, 0.9]$, the objective is to identify how many numbers fall within the range $[0.4, 0.7]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Exact Match Range Query**: If it is guaranteed that the range boundaries $a$ and $b$ correspond to numbers already present in the list, the query can be executed in $O(1)$ time. This approach involves initially creating a hashmap where each number in the list is a key. Subsequently, as the list is traversed, a cumulative count of numbers up to and including each element is recorded. Thus, for a given query, the total count of numbers within the range $[a, b]$ is efficiently computed as $hashmap(b) - hashmap(a)$, leveraging the precomputed counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Arbitrary Range Query**: If the range boundaries $a$ and $b$ can be any arbitrary numbers, potentially not present in the list, the approach requires a binary search to locate the smallest number in the list that is equal to or greater than $a$. Following this, the list is iterated over until an element is encountered that exceeds $b$. This method ensures that all numbers within the range are accurately counted, accommodating the possibility of $a$ and $b$ not aligning with the list's elements.\n"

    "The space complexity of a 2D range tree, designed to manage points along both the x-axis and y-axis, is $O(N\\log N)$. This calculation arises because each level of the tree encompasses all $N$ points, necessitating multiple trees for the secondary axis. However, the collective size of these secondary axis trees remains $O(N)$, and with there being $O(\\log N)$ levels on the primary axis, the overall space complexity consolidates to $O(N\\log N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this framework is extended to 3D range trees, where each level consists of multiple 2D range trees, the space complexity increases to $O(\\log N \\cdot N\\log N) = O(N\\log^2 N)$. By following this pattern, the space complexity for a range tree in $d$ dimensions can be generalized to $O(N\\log^{d-1} N)$, reflecting the complex hierarchical structure inherent in multidimensional range trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of query time for executing rectangular (or by extension, hyper-rectangular) queries, the complexity within a 2D framework is $O(\\log^2 N)$. This stems from the fact that a query into a x-axis finds at most $2$ nodes in each $logN$ levels, which amounts to $O(logN)$. For each node we need to perform $O(\\log N)$ search targeting the y-axis. By applying this principle inductively, the query time for handling queries in a $d$-dimensional range tree scales to $O(\\log^{d} N)$, due to the logarithmic operations required across each dimension for every split.\n"
