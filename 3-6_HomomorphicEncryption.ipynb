    "Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext. Homomorphic encryption can be used for privacy-preserving outsourced storage and computation.\n",

    "For example, a cloud service provider could host encrypted data and perform computations on it without being able to access the data itself. The client can then decrypt the result to obtain the result of the computation.\n",
