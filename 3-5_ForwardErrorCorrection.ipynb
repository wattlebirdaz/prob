    "The channel coded message consists of the source coded message and the parity bit, which is the sum of the source coded message. By adding the parity bit, we can **detect** if there is an error in the channel coded message by checking if the parity bit is consistent with the source coded message. If the parity bit is inconsistent with the source coded message, then there is an error in the channel coded message. Note that we cannot correct the error, only detect it. Also, it will not detect the error if there are more than one error in the channel coded message.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we have a generator matrix same size as the source coded message, i.e. $d=n$, then the smallest (hamming) distance between two distinct code words is $1$. By adding a parity bit, the smallest distance becomes $2$ because if there is a one bit difference between two code words, then the parity bit will also be different. The increase in the smallest distance allows us to detect and correct errors. This simply means that with enough redundancy, we can reject the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detection: If the smallest distance is $d$, then we can detect $d-1$ errors.\n",
    "* Correction: If the smallest distance is $2d+1$, then we can correct $d$ errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we send $3$ copies of the source coded message, then the smallest distance is $3$ because if there is a one bit difference between two code words, then the other two copies will be consistent with the source coded message. Then, if there is an error in the channel coded message, we can fix it by taking the majority of the three copies.\n",

    "$M$ could also be a random matrix. If random, then the algorithm is only guaranteed to work with high probability. The probability of failure can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the size of the matrix.\n",

    "Even if $(x, y)$ is known, it is computationally infeasible to find $M$ if $M$ is a boolean matrix. If $M$ is real, then it is computationally feasible to find $M$ by using newton's method.\n",
